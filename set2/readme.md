TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I learnt a lot of python through what I just did. I did not expect Python could get so mind boggling at times. Still a lot easier than C though. C is so old... it needs an update!

Also can ++ be added to python? I'm sick of entering variable = variable + 1. Why can't I just do variable++?
