TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I learnt how to use Python. Something I already knew how to do 5 years ago. But hey, it's cool.

Also this whole Python gitting thing and installing thing and pipping... You'd think someone who has decent programming knowledge would know something about that... but... apparently not!
